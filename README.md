# Cave Collapse
This game was made as a project for the Introduction to Robotics course, University of Bucharest

The name of the game is Cave Collapse. I chose this name because it feels like you are running in a 2D cave that is collapsing behind you, but you also can't really see too far. So, RUN FOR YOUR LIFE.

The mechanics of the game are pretty simple. You use a joystick to move left/ right/ up/ down OR diagonally (if you are precise enough) while trying to avoid the cave rocks (bright LEDS on the matrix). The more you run, the better score you'll get. You can choose difficuly 1-3 for a score multiplier, but a greater difficulty makes the game progress faster. 

The menu part of the game is pretty basic and intuitive, choose between a few sections matrix brightness settings, LCD brightness/ LCD contrast settings, difficulty, about section and a leaderboard where the top 5 scores are kept. 

I used some basic components, such as:

- 8x8 matrix
- LCD display
- a joystick
- a buzzer
- Arduino Uno board
- matrix controller
- wires, resistors and condensers\
- breadboards

Here are some pictures of the project:
